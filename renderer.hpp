/*
Functions for drawing a bitmap (the map) and circles of
various colors (the players and the ball). The camera
will be static, so there is no need to clip anything from
the scene (although this doesn't allow for bigger maps).
This will also provide info such as when the window resizes
and when it closes, as it contains the whole WINAPI
implementation.
