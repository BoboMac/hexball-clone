/*
Only spheres will be used, so collision will be fairly
trivial. We can either use a system of 2D vectors and
compute the velocity, acceleration and position manually,
or we can use a Box2D setup with no gravity.

There will be a function that will return the position of
each entity, which will then be sent to the server. Even
though this approach is easily hackable, who gives a shit.
